# Open Cap Table Format (OCF)

Data Schema and Specification for Open Cap Format (OCF) published by the [Open Cap Table Coalition](https://opencaptablecoalition.com). You can also check out some of past announcements related to OCF and the Coalition on our [Medium Page](https://medium.com/@opencaptable).

## What is OCF?

OCF (or **O**pen **C**ap Table **F**ormat) is a data standard developed by the Open Cap Table Coalition to enable the
easy and accurate exchange and use of company capitalization information through a standardized format. It is made
freely available for anyone to use, though changes must be made through the Coalition's [change process](#developer-information).

OCF is a JSON-based format, wherein individual objects required to describe a company cap table are stored in JSONs that match our OCF JSON Schemas. Our reference implementation suggests storing these JSONs in a specific set of files in a zip archive, but OCF-compatible data could be provided via API as well. Please see our documentation for more details on JSON Schema, OCF's schemas or how to use them.

## Documentation

We have extensive, auto-generated documentation available on our [documentation page](https://jsv4.github.io/OCF-Docs-Test/). The documents are automatically updated with every update to OCF.

You an find samples in our repo in the samples folder, or, check out our tutorials (again, through the documentation) to see how to get started with OCF and download complete, sample OCF cap tables.

## OCF Schema

OCF's schema is defined in our JSON Schemas, which can be found in the /schema folder of our repository. All of our documentation is automatically generated from these source files, so they should remain in sync.
